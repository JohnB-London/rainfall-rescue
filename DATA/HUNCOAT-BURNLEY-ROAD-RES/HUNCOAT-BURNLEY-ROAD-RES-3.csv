NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This gauge replaced the old gauge in 1959 at a location 530 ft. West of the existing gauge. They overlapped for 10 months and there is good agreement between tha gauges,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Grid Reference on the 1950s sheet is clear and consistent with that for the Old Gauge,,,,,,,,,,,,,
